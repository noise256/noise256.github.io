				Self-Propelled Particles are used to model flocking, swarming and schooling behaviour and have been used to describe a rich host of biological species such as Starlings and Locusts. 
				
				Swarming behaviour is described at an individual scale where independent particles determine their movement from the positioning and orientation of the particles in their vicinity. 
				The large scale order visible in the group emerges from the local interaction of the agents within the group and demonstrates how the SPP model is often used to explain how flocking animals
				are able to form highly ordered groups without any centralised control or apparent leadership.
				
				In this relatively minimal form, the model uses three rules to determine direction of movement of the particles at the next time step. 
				These rules describe interaction between independent particles whereby they are repulsed at close distances, aligned at moderate distances and attracted at far distances.
